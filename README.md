# Java-organizing
Program to run in command line, write info of the day, then you can search the kind of data from numbers or words to get the preferred data of the day/s requested.
This is my first complete program ever made as hobby. (before was ms-access done with vs.net back in highschool)

Indent of the code is lost with time, this project is just for me to remember how it was to re-learn to code, as hobby.
